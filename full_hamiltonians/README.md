## FCI Hamiltonians for hydrogen chains or rings.
* Six atoms per chain or ring
* The full CI Hamiltonian matrices include nuclear repulsion as a constant term 
added to the diagonal. 
* Generated via PySCF with a STO-6G basis.
* All hydrogen chains or rings are equidistant, with a nearest-neighbor distance of
either 1.0, 1.5, or 2.0 Angstroms.
